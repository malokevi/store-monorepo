I needed a loaner machine when my CPAP machine quit and was treated fantastically. I was at the store today to get my new machine and had a great experience, Tammy was a great help and I learned some valuable information. All of the girls were really friendly and made the replacement of my machine as good experience. I always highly recommend the Burlington store when ever I can, they are to be commended.",
